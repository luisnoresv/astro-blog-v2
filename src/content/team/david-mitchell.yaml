bio: Born in 1964 in Brighton, United Kingdom, David Mitchell’s journey into the world of photography began in the vibrant 1980s. His early career was marked by his work with prestigious fashion houses across Hong Kong, Singapore, and Bangkok, where his lens captured the essence of a dynamic era in fashion. As the new millennium dawned, Mitchell’s artistic direction took a turn towards the abstract. He began to incorporate color into his photography, a move inspired by the frequent requests of private collectors. This period marked a significant evolution in his work, as he started to explore non-objective imagery defined by an inventive interplay of lines, planes, and colors, forming patterns that were unspecific yet captivating. Mitchell’s work is not just about capturing moments but creating art. He challenges the conventional notion that photography is about representation, embracing pure non-objectivity instead. His collections, primarily comprised of non-objective images since 2010, are a testament to this philosophy. A unique aspect of Mitchell’s life is his experience with Left Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, which induces heightened abstract emotions and prolonged déjà vu experiences. These medical auras intensify his sense of familiar connections and alter perceptions, deeply influencing his artistic vision.
